## About
There are things that the server does better. Frontend's responsibility is to render the view.
Classic MVVM approach significanly complicates work with data. In fact, on practice a frontend developer would end up writing the code that would be better performed by server rather than a client (routing, requesting data, filtering data, cooking a view model, caching, etc). 
I believe that the server has to be responsible for the view model. There are things which the server does better and working with data is one of them.


## The Stack
| Server        | Client        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Routing (Express.JS ) | Navigation (Turbolinks) |
| View Model (FeathersJS)    | Data Representation (RiotJS) |
| Layout Rendering (RiotJS SSR) | User input (RiotJS)  |
| Session / User State (Express.js) | JWT, Cookies |
| Realtime (Feathers, SocketIO) | FeathersJS Client |
| DB Interface (FeathersJS Client) | Rest/IO (FeathersJS Client) |
